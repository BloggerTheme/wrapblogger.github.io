  <h2 class="card-title">Should I update my Bloggerpack based theme?</h2>
  <p class="card-text">Bloggerpack is the starting point for a new theme. When you used it to create a theme you just created a brand new theme using Bloggerpack as a head start.</p>
  <p class="card-text">There isn't really even anything to update. At this point it has become your theme and it doesn't depend on Bloggerpack.</p>
  <p class="card-text">If you see an update to Bloggerpack that you would like to implement on your own Bloggerpack based theme, then you will need to inspect the change and figure out how to manually implement it on your own theme, and you'll need to approach these changes case by case.</p>
